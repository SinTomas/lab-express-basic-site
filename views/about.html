            <h1>The oldest professional Football Club in Wales</h1>
            <div class="about-info">
                Wrexham Football Club is no ordinary football club. Founded in 1864, just one year after the Football Association first met and the Laws of the Game were first written, Wrexham is the third oldest professional football club in the world.
            </br>
                Over the years, the team and its ever-loyal supporters have experienced together the joy of victory, the frustration of near success and the despair that follows defeat.
            The fans have cheered each time a goal has'hit the back of the opposing team's net.
            When Wrexham have been ahead, they have anxiously counted down those final, seemingly endless minutes of injury time before exploding with joy as the final whistle blows.
            They have never given up; even when all hope of victory has slipped away.
        </br>
            Wrexham fans have witnessed the highs and the lows that are the milestones in the story of every football club.
        </br>
            This website details those milestones and includes additional information about those events in the history of the club and the Racecourse.
        </br>

        In November 2020, Canadian-American actor Ryan Reynolds and American actor Rob McElhenney, through their RR McReynolds Company LLC, bought the club. The deal received the backing of 98.6% of the 2,000 members of the Wrexham Supporters Trust that voted and was completed in February 2021. They were included in FIFA 22 as part of the "Rest of World" section, becoming the first non-league team to be featured in the series.In 2021–22, Wrexham finished 2nd before losing the play-off semi-final 5–4 to Grimsby Town after extra time. Wrexham also reached the 2022 FA Trophy Final which they lost 1–0 to Bromley.
        </br>
        Following the takeover, a docuseries called Welcome to Wrexham was announced to be in production for FX with Boardwalk Pictures. The series debuted on 24 August 2022 on FX and Hulu in the USA, followed by a release on Disney+ in the United Kingdom and Ireland the next day.The acquisition by Reynolds and McElhenney and the attendant publicity from Welcome to Wrexham had a significant impact on the club's visibility, leading to its acquiring a new global fanbase with no precedent for a team in the fifth division. The club's fortunes began to attract dedicated coverage from global sporting media that would not typically be afforded teams outside the Premier League. This in turn inspired debate about the potential replicability of this strategy for other lesser-known clubs and leagues, with The Guardian remarking that "everybody wants to ‘do a Wrexham’, but not everybody can."
        </br>
        During the 2022–23 season, the team progressed to the fourth round in the 2022–23 FA Cup, being the only National League team to be able to do so, beating Coventry City in an upset in the third round, and eventually being knocked out by Sheffield United in a replay. The first game against Sheffield United was ESPN's most followed football game across its digital platforms. Wrexham vied with Notts County throughout the season to lead the league, trading the first spot back and forth, and both setting new National League records for wins, goals, and goal difference, while 20+ points ahead of the third place team by the end of the season. On 22 April 2023, Wrexham secured winning their first league title in 45 years, and were promoted to the EFL League Two after a 15 year absence, following a 3–1 win against Boreham Wood. The club amassed a tally of 111 points that season, a record for the top five divisions of English League football, beating Notts County to the championship and single automatic promotion spot.

        158TH ANNIVERSARY OF FIRST EVER MATCH
        Wales’ oldest football club and the third oldest professional club in the world, Wrexham AFC, celebrate the anniversary of their first match on October 22 – 158 years on from that first game in 1864.
        Two weeks on from the announcement in the Wrexham Advertiser that Wrexham Cricket Club were to form a football team, a match took place between ‘ten of the Prince of Wales Fire Brigade and ten of the club’.
        “On Saturday last a foot ball match was played on the ground at the Turf Tavern, between ten of the Prince of Wales Fire Brigade and ten of the club, which resulted in an easy victory for the fire brigade, they winning the first two goals out of three.” (Wrexham Advertiser, 29/10/1864)
        Wrexham’s first ever line-up was as follows: C. E. Kershaw, J. Taylor, T. Hanmer, E. Knibbs, T. Broster, G. R. Johnson, T. Sykes, Jos. Roberts, Sergt, Hearth, Sergt. Tootell.
        Now, 158 years on, many things may have changed in football, in the town and in North Wales, but Wrexham, the Racecourse and the Turf Tavern remain.
        From those humble beginnings, Wrexham became the epicentre for North Walian football – and Welsh football as a whole. Indeed, the Football Association of Wales was formed in the town 12 years later.
        Previously used for horse racing and cricket, the Racecourse Ground hosted Wales’ first ever home international match on 5th March, 1877 – making the ground the oldest international football stadium in the world, still in continuous use.
        The Town then won the inaugural Welsh Cup the following year, beating Druids 1-0 in the final at nearby Acton Park with a last-minute goal.
        As with so many facets of the town and the club, Wrexham wrote the script for others to follow – their tactical innovations in that final later becoming the norm across the footballing sphere.
